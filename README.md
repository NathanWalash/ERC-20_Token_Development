# ERC-20_Token_Development

# DAO System with GoCardless Integration

This system enables users to join DAOs, make fiat-based recurring contributions through GoCardless, and participate in claims and voting within a smart contract system using a shared ERC-20 stablecoin (`DAOUSD`).

## Overview

The architecture integrates the Ethereum blockchain with GoCardless for fiat payments. DAO members contribute funds at intervals determined by each DAO. Contributions in fiat are converted into DAOUSD tokens, which represent value on-chain and are used for all treasury operations, including insurance-like claims and payouts.

## Key Components

- **DAOUSD**: A stable ERC-20 token pegged to fiat currency (e.g., 1 DAOUSD = 1 USD). Minted and burned by the backend upon confirmed GoCardless transactions.
- **DAO Smart Contract**: Manages groups, membership, contribution tracking, voting, and claim payouts.
- **GoCardless Integration**: Facilitates recurring bank debits from members to a central treasury wallet managed by the DAO's backend.
- **Backend Service**: Handles webhook processing, DAOUSD minting, user verification, and synchronizing on-chain actions with off-chain fiat payments.

## Flow: Fiat Contributions via GoCardless

### 1. DAO Creation

- A user deploys or creates a new DAO group using the `createGroup` function.
- The group defines:
  - Contribution amount (e.g., $20)
  - Contribution interval (e.g., monthly)
  - Target treasury size
  - Quorum rules for voting (default: 51%)

### 2. User Onboarding

- User visits frontend, connects wallet, and joins a DAO group.
- The frontend prompts user to set up a GoCardless direct debit mandate.
- Backend registers the user with GoCardless and creates a subscription that matches DAO contribution rules.

### 3. Contribution Handling

- On each billing cycle:
  - GoCardless charges the user’s bank account.
  - The backend receives a webhook confirming successful payment.
  - Backend mints an equivalent amount of DAOUSD to the user’s wallet.
  - Backend optionally logs the contribution on-chain via `contributeWithToken`.

### 4. Treasury Management

- DAO contract tracks total pot value in DAOUSD.
- Users can view contribution history, pot status, and funding goals on the frontend.
- The smart contract enforces rules for negative pots and premium charges if needed.

## Flow: Claims and Voting

### 1. Claim Submission

- Any DAO member can submit a claim using the `createClaim` function.
- The claim specifies the amount requested and is logged on-chain.

### 2. Voting Process

- Members vote on the claim using `voteOnClaim`, selecting `Upvote` or `Downvote`.
- Each user may vote once per claim.
- The claim remains open until a quorum is reached.

### 3. Quorum Calculation

- A claim is eligible for finalization if:
  - At least 51% of confirmed group members have voted
  - More upvotes than downvotes have been recorded

### 4. Finalization and Payout

- Admin or custodian calls `finalizeClaim`.
- If approved:
  - The claim is marked approved and processed.
  - The specified DAOUSD amount is transferred to the claimer’s wallet.
- If rejected:
  - The claim is marked processed but no payout is made.

## Flow: Fiat Redemption (Optional)

If fiat redemption is enabled:

- The user initiates a redemption request via the frontend.
- Backend burns the requested DAOUSD from the user’s wallet.
- Backend initiates a payout through GoCardless or via bank transfer from the treasury account.
- Confirmation is logged for auditability.

---

## Security and Compliance Notes

- Only the backend may mint or burn DAOUSD, guarded by admin role.
- Users must approve DAO smart contract before tokens can be transferred for contributions.
- Fiat custody is centralized and must comply with local financial regulations and KYC/AML requirements.

## Technologies

- Solidity (DAO and DAOUSD contracts)
- GoCardless API
- Node.js/Express or similar backend
- Web3.js or Ethers.js frontend integration
- PostgreSQL or MongoDB for tracking mandates and payments

## Future Improvements

- Add multi-currency fiat support (GBP, EUR)
- Automatic DAO pot rebalancing based on claim history
- DAO-controlled mint/burn rights via governance
